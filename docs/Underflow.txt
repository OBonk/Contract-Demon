The Ethereum virtual machine has a set maximum size for certain data types. For
example a unit8 will only store 0-255 so storing 256 in a unit8 would result in 0
and vice versa, -1 will result in 255. This can cause unexpected and potentially
dangerous behaviour such as if someone attempted to withdraw more Ether than
existed in their balance in an Etherstore this could result in underflow and therefore
their balance would loop round to being much higher than it should be.

The error is not in a specific location in the vulnerable contract, instead OppenZepplin has a 
safemath library which should be used when performing arithmatic.
